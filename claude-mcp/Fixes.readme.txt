## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Critical Syntax Error

- __Fixed__: Changed `InitializationOptions{` to `InitializationOptions(` on line 647
- __Impact__: This was preventing the script from running at all

### 2. Proper Resource Management

- __Implemented__: Added async context manager methods (`__aenter__` and `__aexit__`) to the `N8NMCPServer` class
- __Changed__: Moved HTTP client initialization from global scope to instance-managed within the server class
- __Updated__: All `http_client` references throughout the code now use `self.http_client`
- __Enhanced__: Modified the main function to use the async context manager for proper resource cleanup

## Key Improvements:

1. __Resource Safety__: The HTTP client is now properly initialized when the server starts and automatically closed when the server shuts down
2. __Memory Management__: Prevents resource leaks by ensuring the HTTP client connections are properly closed
3. __Error Handling__: The async context manager ensures cleanup even if exceptions occur
4. __Code Structure__: Better encapsulation with the HTTP client as an instance variable rather than a global

## Technical Details:

- The `N8NMCPServer` class now implements the async context manager protocol
- HTTP client is created in `__aenter__()` and closed in `__aexit__()`
- All HTTP requests throughout the codebase now use the properly managed `self.http_client`
- The main function uses `async with N8NMCPServer() as mcp_server:` for automatic resource management

The MCP server is now ready for deployment with proper resource management and no syntax errors.
